# Lindholmen Lunch

**Lindholmen Lunch** – Your daily lunch overview for Gothenburg's Lindholmen district.

**Lindholmen Lunch** is a Python project that fetches, parses, and summarizes lunch menus from various restaurants in Lindholmen, Gothenburg. It scrapes menus from multiple restaurant websites, organizes the data by weekday, and generates user-friendly HTML summaries for easy viewing.

## Features

- Scrapes lunch menus from several Lindholmen restaurants using dedicated scrapers.
- Stores daily menu data in JSON files under the `data/` directory.
- Generates summary HTML pages for each weekday and a weekly overview.
- Modular scraper architecture for easy extension to new restaurants.
- Includes sample HTML files and test data for development and testing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Google Chrome (for Selenium-based scrapers)
- ChromeDriver installed and in your PATH


## Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Scrape menus and generate HTML:**

    Scraped data is cached in data/lunch_data_<day>.json and reused unless --refresh is passed.

   - To scrape and generate the summary for today:
     ```sh
     python main.py
     ```
   - To scrape for a specific day (e.g., "monday"):
     ```sh
     python main.py --day monday
     ```
   - Force refresh for a specific day (e.g., "monday"):
     ```sh
     python main.py --day monday --refresh
     ```
   - Force refresh for all days:
     ```sh
     python main.py --all --refresh
     ```

3. **View results:**
   - Open the generated HTML files in your browser (e.g., `docs/index.html`, `docs/lunch_monday.html`).

## Adding a New Restaurant

1. Create a new scraper in the `scrapers/` directory by subclassing `LunchScraper`.
2. Implement the scraping logic for the restaurant's website.
3. Add the new scraper to the `SCRAPERS` list in [`main.py`](main.py).

## Development & Testing

- Run or adapt tests as needed to verify scraper correctness.
